Synchronizing Audio and Text in a Gradio Web App
Gradio is a powerful Python library that simplifies the process of creating user interfaces for machine learning models. It offers a variety of components, including audio and text elements, which can be used to build interactive web applications. This article explores the possibility of creating a Gradio web app that synchronizes an audio recording with its corresponding text transcript, highlighting the relevant portion of the text as the audio plays. This functionality has numerous applications, including:
* Accessibility: Making content accessible to users with visual impairments.
* Language Learning: Aiding language learners by providing synchronized audio and text.
* Content Creation: Facilitating the creation of interactive educational materials or presentations.
* Interactive Storytelling: Enhancing storytelling experiences with synchronized audio and visual elements.
Gradio's Audio and Text Elements
Gradio provides dedicated components for handling audio and text data within its interface.
Audio
The gr.Audio component 1 allows users to upload, record, or stream audio files. It supports various functionalities such as displaying audio waveforms, controlling playback, and setting limitations on audio length. Furthermore, it offers event listeners like Audio.stream(), Audio.change(), and Audio.clear() that can be used to trigger functions based on user interactions with the audio component.
For more advanced use cases, the gr.HTML component 2 can be used to embed a custom audio player within the Gradio interface. This provides developers with more fine-grained control over the audio playback and synchronization process, allowing for greater customization and flexibility.
Text
Gradio offers several components for displaying text, each with unique features:
* gr.Textbox 3: A basic component for single-line text input and output. It can be customized with parameters like lines to control the number of visible lines, max_lines to limit user input, and placeholder to provide initial text.
* gr.TextArea 3: Similar to gr.Textbox but designed for multi-line text.
* gr.HighlightedText 4: Allows for specific parts of the text to be highlighted, which is particularly useful for tasks like named entity recognition or sentiment analysis.
Synchronizing Audio and Text
While Gradio doesn't have a built-in feature for direct audio-text synchronization, it's possible to achieve this functionality by combining its components with external libraries and custom JavaScript code. Here's a potential approach:
1. Audio Processing and Transcription: Use a speech-to-text library (e.g., Whisper) to generate a transcript of the audio recording. This process might involve segmenting the audio and transcribing each segment to obtain timestamps for individual words or phrases5.
2. Timestamped Transcript: Store the transcript with corresponding timestamps in a suitable format, such as JSON or a list of tuples. For example:
JSON
[
 {"text": "The", "start": 0.0, "end": 0.2},
 {"text": "quick", "start": 0.2, "end": 0.5},
 {"text": "brown", "start": 0.5, "end": 0.8},
 {"text": "fox", "start": 0.8, "end": 1.1}
]

3. Gradio Interface:
   * Use gr.Audio to display and control the audio playback.
   * Use gr.HighlightedText or gr.HTML to display the transcript.
   4. JavaScript Integration: Implement JavaScript code that listens to the audio playback events and highlights the corresponding text segment based on the current playback time and the timestamped transcript. This might involve manipulating the DOM to dynamically update the highlighted portion of the text. For instance, you could use JavaScript's addEventListener to track the timeupdate event on the audio element and then update the styling of the corresponding text span based on the current time6. provides a basic example of such an implementation.

Conclusion
Creating a Gradio web app with synchronized audio and text playback is achievable by combining Gradio's versatile components with external libraries and custom JavaScript code. Although Gradio doesn't offer a built-in solution, the flexibility of its framework allows developers to implement this feature using a variety of methods. By integrating audio processing, generating timestamped transcripts, and implementing dynamic text highlighting through JavaScript, developers can create engaging and interactive applications that enhance user experience and cater to diverse needs, such as accessibility and language learning. The availability of tools like audiosync, syncabook, and forced alignment libraries further facilitates this process. By leveraging these resources and the support of the Gradio community, developers can unlock the full potential of Gradio to build innovative and user-friendly applications.
